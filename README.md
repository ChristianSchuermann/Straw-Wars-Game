Title: Straw Wars Game

A space-invaders-like like 2D game

You experience a random amount of random stormtroopers comming along your way. 
Shoot them down or lose the game.
Move your character via the arrow-keys. Press Space to shoot.


Mostly written in JS, little use of CSS / HTML (using a canvas).



Challenging:

1. The problems of not letting the displayed characters go out of bounds, bouncing the enemies back when reaching the top or the bottom of the canvas,
   while moving them forwards.
  
2. Detecting a direct hit on the player, or the enemies.

3. Creating a random amount of new enemies to appear on the screen after a random amount of time.
